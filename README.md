## This project is a CRUD API aka Create, Read, Update, and Delete.
Created Using JS, NodeJS, Express, Nodemon, Mongoose, and MongoDB.
Tested and Developed Using Insomnia

Javascript - Programming language.
NodeJS - Javascript server runtime environment.
Express - NodeJS web application framework.
Nodemon - NodeJS tool allowing for asynchronous express development.
Mongoose - NodeJS ODM library for easy manipulation and reading of MongoDB database.
MongoDB - Database used to hold our 'product' information.
Insomnia - API Debugging/Testing Utility.

## Using JavaScript and NodeJS, I have created a simple Backend API that can serve the following functions.
1. C reate a new instance of 'product' which is initialized and declared into our MongoDB Database.
2. R ead existing instances of 'product' or a singular instance based on its product ID number from the Database.
3. U pdate existing instances of 'product' to replace the value(s) associated with the 'product'.
4. D elete existing instances of 'product' from the database based on its ID number.

## Future Project Goals.
1. Create a front-end product to push and pull from the database.
2. Implement security features on the backend to prevent DB injection or bad action.
