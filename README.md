## CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete.)
- This CRUD API is a simple implementation of a RESTful API.
- I Created This Using JS, NodeJS, Express, Nodemon, Mongoose, and MongoDB.
- Tested Using Insomnia and Postman

## Purpose
I started this project to gain a stronger understanding of JavaScript and NodeJS to prepare for my IBM Joint Study Interview.
Additionally, I hoped to gain a more comprehensive understanding of backend development and APIs.
Finally, I looked to gain experience in using and manipulating a database.

## Tools Used
- Javascript - Programming language.
- NodeJS - Javascript server runtime environment.
- Express - NodeJS web application framework.
- Nodemon - NodeJS tool allowing for asynchronous express development.
- Mongoose - NodeJS ODM library for easy manipulation and reading of MongoDB database.
- MongoDB - Database used to hold our 'product' information.
- Insomnia - RESTful API Debugging/Testing Utility.

## Using JavaScript and NodeJS, I have created a simple Backend API that can serve the following functions.
1. <b>C</b> reate a new instance of 'product' which is initialized and declared into our MongoDB Database.
2. <b>R</b> ead existing instances of 'product' or a singular instance based on its product ID number from the Database.
3. <b>U</b> pdate existing instances of 'product' to replace the value(s) associated with the 'product'.
4. <b>D</b> elete existing instances of 'product' from the database based on its ID number.

## Future Project Goals.
1. Create a front-end product to push and pull from the database.
2. Implement security features on the backend to prevent DB injection or bad action.
